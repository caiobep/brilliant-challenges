# Brilliant Course Notes

> Some notes I take while doing courses at [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/).

This repo contains personal code that I write in order to answer [Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/) challenges questions. I usually write all my notes on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), but since I was constantly writting code, I've decided to share a little bit here
